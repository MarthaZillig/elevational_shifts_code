This is code for the in-review Ecography research article entitled "Shifts in elevational distrubitions of montane birds in an arid ecosystem" 

All .csv files are model summaries for species that displayed significant elevational movement. The name of the .csv file represent the species code, region (central or western) and which elevational model the outputs are referring to (full elevational gradient, or upper or lower 25% of gradient)
